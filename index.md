# About Me

Well, I've been programming for over a decade, and I'm finally starting to get
good at it.  I mostly do full stack development because how else am I going to
publish what I do.  I've done
[LAMP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LAMP_(software_bundle)), but have since
moved onto [MERN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MEAN_(solution_stack)).
I'm currently learning Angular and JavaEE, later I'll add a few more frontend
frameworks to my repertoire, and then finally work on some machine learning.

My long term goal is to use my programming abilities to solve scientific
problems, but lab equipment is expensive.  In the mean time, I'm trying to be a
more active member of the GitHub community.
